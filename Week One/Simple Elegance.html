<p>If you’re thinking SimpleSite might be the best website builder for you, or you’re unsure and want to find out more, then you’re in the right place. We’ve tried and tested it ourselves, and now we’re ready to share our findings with you.

    Are you ready to find out if SimpleSite is simply the best builder for you? Sit back and strap in as we take you through features, ease of use, pricing, and more!  This is a fairly bizarre way of doing things – you can specify which type of business site you’re setting up, for example, but not whether your personal site is a portfolio, blog, or CV.

    Because of this, our top tip is to choose the “business” option, no matter what type of site you’re building. This lets you browse all of SimpleSite’s themes to find one that suits your needs.
    
    Once you have your theme, customization is pretty basic. The good news is that despite its rather roundabout way of doing things, SimpleSite does make it very easy to add elements, such as text and images. Yes, it gives you mobile-optimized pages, which Google loves, and has guides showing you how to use keywords in your headings. But you’re very limited in what you can do to optimize your site – for starters, you can’t install any apps, insert Google Analytics, or access the code of your pages.</p>
